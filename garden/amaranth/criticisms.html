    <p class="marigold">if you have so much criticism for your friends, why don't you just tell them? won't they improve?</p>
    <p class="amaranth">well. i have a tendency to go too hard. i am a little brash.</p>
    <p class="marigold">what do you mean?</p>
    <p class="amaranth">i have countless things i can say. and in the past i'd beat down my friends and they'd get back up ... maybe not better but more, fierce? stronger? if that makes any sense. but i feel like these one are perhaps too fragile. i feel like if i beat them down they might not get back up.</p>
    <p class="marigold">don't you think you underestimate your friends</p>
    <p class="amaranth">me? underestimate? i think that my friends are stronger than they know themselves. but that's the problem. i don't think they know what they could be.</p>
    <p class="amaranth">they've got glass hearts, and i've been given a bat. could you blame me for being so wary?</p>
