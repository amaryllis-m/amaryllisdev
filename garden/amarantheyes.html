      <p>amaranths writhe further than you care to see.</p>
      <p>there is something wrong about them, but you find it hard to describe. flowers drink the sacrifices of travellers gone by. they do not seem to welcome you.</p>
      <!-- a world built on blood, for nothing can grow without pain. stained hands have sown this garden. its a culmination of my sins. i can see the monstrosity i have made; yet a part of me welcomes it. -->
      <p>in your periphery, you see them shift and stare. you have wandered far into some divine place.</p>
      <p>they do not speak, at least in any way that you could hope to understand, but you <strong>know</strong> they mock you.</p>
