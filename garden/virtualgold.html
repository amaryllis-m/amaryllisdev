    <p>a beautiful field of shining marigolds and budding yetrealised amaryllises-to-be. and despite it, you feel weighed down by the very universe itself, for today falls with no stars left to hold it up.</p>
    <p>wistful echoes from dreams long buried ring out from the ground. the world sings, but you know it is not meant for you. you stand on the graveyard of the soul.</p>
    <p>the flowers seem to invite you, but you'll always be something different from them.</p>
