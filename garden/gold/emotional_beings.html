    <p>what do you think makes humans different? for a dog can feel joy and a crow can problem solve. we say that humans are creatures of reason but if so, then there are other creatures of reason out there that we don't recognise as being human like us.</p>
    <p>i think that its all the negative emotions that we feel. i wonder what other animal could comprehend the depths of our anger and the absolute despair of our sadnesses. what individuals from other species hates themselves as we do, for our mistakes that hurt each other, and for our nonmistakes that didn't. what other animal is about to reflect on everything they've done and despair like us.</p>
    <p>they look up at the beautiful starry night sky and see motes of lights. we look up and -- unable to cope with our insignificance in the face of it all -- turn to look away. not out of incomprehension or misunderstanding</p>
    <p>do they weep at night? does the though keep them up?</p>
    <p>does emotion pour from every fibre of their being, and are they aware that they cannot contain it all? do they yet hold it in for fear of bearing their hearts for others to see?</p>
    <p>have you seen a cat or a turtle beg for ignorance, because they have been given the faculties to perceive and feel?</p>
    <p>humans are creatures of emotion. we are irrational, and there is no shame in that. we act on fear and anger and hopelessness and pain. and i'm tired of people pretending we don't; of people pretending that we are rational agents that are able to make decisions that make sense. and sure, to be emotional is to be messy, to be amorphous, to be unable to be properly expressed in words or crafts but have to try nonetheless; and that can be terrifying. because unable to be named, we believe that we cannot control ourselves nor understand others.</p>
    <p>but it isn't true.</p>
