						<h1><a href=".">a</a>ll roads...</h1>
						<p>I feel that I have no done much this year. Far less than I have done before.</p>
						<p>There was joy in taking my time, but by the end I recognise that I have nothing to show for it. Not everything needs such things, but I have been unable to see anything through.</p>
						<p>Let us live industriously, for time is scarse, and you'll only find how valuable it was once it has slipped from your fingers.</p>
						<p><small>I give myself 20 short years. A year is far too long a time to waste now. Perhaps it all does not matter at the end, but I wish to paint the world when I still can.</small></p>
