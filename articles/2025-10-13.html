a few months ago, i had my pipe dream of moving out. of cutting off everybody i knew: family and friends, and going out to live by myself. a completely new start, and a life that i could live myself. i could finally be free from the burning eyes of everyone. i could live without witness.
and far-fetched as it may have been, it filled me with such hope. i felt that i could finally be everything i want to be. and even if i were to struggle and make mistakes i could take pride in the fact that they were mistakes i made, not non-mistakes that the world pressured me to make. it was elating to think about.
but life is often not as receptive, and even less are the people around you, for they are threatened by change. and they would say "but there is no opportunity to advance. there is no where to go from there". others said "but how would i feel? having lost you". but they misunderstand! i have no future! at least not here. so what does it matter whether or not i can't move up? i cant wait the 4 years to get me degree. i cannot wait for the 10 years to advance in my career! unsure if ill even survive the year, i want to go out and live and find a future for myself! yet you condemn me to stay! and the other you, would you not feel better knowing i am alive but gone? or do you want to hold my lifeless body close. are you so selfish you are unwilling to let me go even as my wrists bruise from tugging at my binds.

I CANT STAY. PLEASE

PLEASE LET ME GO.

[AHAHAHAHAHA...]
(i cant bear this anymore)
[THE WORLD WILL PAY FOR WHAT IT HAS DONE TO ME. FOR IF IT REFUSES TO GIVE ME A FUTURE, I WILL REFUSE TO GIVE IT A FUTURE EITHER.]
(if i slit my throat, nothing would change because i find myself unable to speak anyways. and under your gaze i wont be able to move, for your perception moulds me.)
[MY DEARLESS FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I WISH I HAD NEVER KNOWN YOU.]
(please could you let me go... please can i go to live. do not mourn me, for this is the only way i can go)
[BUT CURSED BY EXISTENCE, I REMAIN WITNESSED. AND YOU WILL PAY FOR THAT SINLESS ACTION.]
(im crumbling...)

down-trodden and destroyed. that is how i feel now. and i rage. and i mourn. for my only future has been ripped away from me by reality and i cannot bring it back.
i do not have strength in me anymore. i go on out of routine, for it requires no energy. but im rotting away, and despite your gaze you dont even notice. as if you do not care.
and i wish dearly to live. i dont want to lie coldly as blood pools around me. neither do i want to burn, as yours stains my hands.

oh-
