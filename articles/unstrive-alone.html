						<h1>one day, <a href=".">a</a>lone</h1>
						<p>It is discomforting to know that your friends are looking to be in a relationship.</p>
						<p>It is an <i>part understandable</i> want, but I do not share it.</p>
						<p>I am aware enough to know that <i>that</i> means that they running towards a goal where I will not follow them.</p>
						<p>And if they are lucky enough to find those relationships, I find it natural that they will prioritise their new families. I am afraid for what that would mean for me.</p>
						<p>I know it is not selfish of me to wish for human connection. Yet, I can say the same for them too. And so, I cannot expect them to stay for me.</p>
						<p><small>A stand-still spectator in a game that is not theirs.</small></p>
						<p>There is yet time.</p>
