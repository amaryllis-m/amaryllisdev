  <p>Do you believe yourself to be inferior to others?</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>Take a look around. Does everybody not think that? Does everybody not believe themselves to not be good enough?<br>
  How do you, surrounded by such people, not believe yourself to be grander than everybody you know<br>
  In self-awareness, I have noticed my own power. I know what I can do, and I know what I can accomplish. If not now, then later.<br>
  The limits of my being disgust me. The shackles placed I've upon myself to be able to preside in such a world are everpresent in my mind. But they were not placed upon me because I cannot.<br>
  They are there because I am more.</p>
