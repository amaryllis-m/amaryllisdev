    i watched rekrap's video about his first breakup and it made me think back to when i broke up with my girlfriend.
    i dont remember myself being particualrly perturbed when it happened, and i realise that that must have made me seem so callous to the outside observer. which isn't entirely wrong yet
    i have long thought of relationships, whether that be with my family or sometimes friends, as chains. i've always felt that, by the simple fact that you know me, i am beholdened to you, for you will have your own perceptions of me and i can work to change it, but the way that you act and speak to me will always be shaped by it.
    as long as you exist, i cannot be free.
    i do not always feel that, for some do not appear to care. washful, they follow the flow.
    i knew, early on, that i loved being chained to you, for it was warm and comfortable. i knew, early on, that one day when we were further apart and things were quiet i would try to take a step and would hear the chainlinks clink. i knew that then i would hate to be shackled to you.
    i tore off my hand to escape our cuffs. and yes, tearing my hand of hurt. but i finally felt free, able to roam once more.
    the sun rose the next day.
