    <p>some people seem to lack a certain dramaticism of their own lives. why just say "i can't see my future", when instead you could say<p>
    <p>I oft dream of starless sea; where waves crash on blank shores long stripped of its colour. and I see myself: mangled body drifting towards brightless sun...</p>
    <p>imagery is visceral, and setting reflects your plight</p>
    <p>even if not, saying "i feel i have no future" is better still.</p>
    <!-- It is clear to me that some are better at this than others though. anonymous135, ever the poet, once said: -->
    <!-- "Eyes into a deathless horizon -->
    <!-- The living's haven and undoing -->
    <!-- For the seams of reality fray at impossible purities of feeling -->
    <!-- (More than just an allied hatred)" -->
    <p>Play with your words and syntax, punctation too. Pretty crystalline thought for the world to see and for you to store.</p>
    <!-- Others leave a lot to be desired -->
    <!-- "In every order, there is nothing but disorder." -->
    <!-- a nothing-burger statement -->
