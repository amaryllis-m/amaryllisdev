	    <p><em>"... but he caused a tumult among them, by producing in them diverse languages, and causing that, through the multitude of those languages, they should not be able to understand one another."</em></p>
	    <p><strong>this is not a rule!!</strong></p>
	    <p>for the minecraft smp: do not communicate in english or with any other world language (or other commonly understood symbols).</p>
	    <p>the goal is to let a language (or something that could be called that) arise naturally due to a need to communicate, and let it change and evolve as time goes on.</p>
	    <p>ooh new words and grammer, syntax and phonetics too! phonotactics and phrases and linguistic history! it's all so exciting!</p>
	    <h2>advice</h2>
	    <p class="subtitle">or other guidelines</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li><strong>languages are not ciphers of english.</strong> it is not a word for word replacement.</li>
	      <li>don't have a word yet? <strong>just make one.</strong> and if others use it too...</li>
	      <li>don't like a word? <strong>change it or make a new one.</strong> nobody is stopping you! same goes for grammar</li>
	      <li><strong>stick to voice!</strong> if you can. text solidifies spelling and pronunciation, and we don't want that (yet)</li>
	      <li><strong>silence is golden.</strong> if you have nothing to say, don't say anything. without the vast words of english, it will be hard to piece together things anyways.</li>
	      <li>try to keep up.</li>
