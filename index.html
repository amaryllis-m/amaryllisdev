	    <h1>welcome!</h1>
	    <p>welcome to amaryllis.dev, website of marigold (any domains with marigold were already taken or too expensive). if i am going to be hoenst, i have no real clue what i will use this website for but i did want to reclaim my place on the internet and break free from it all so i have made this.</p>
	    <p>the wild west that is the internet. it is a shame that it was tamed by corporations and made to extract every last piece of value.</p>
	    <p>it seems to me that everybody is running forward, or worrying that they are not. what lies in the horizon that you so desperatly wish to find? is it that my myopic eyes fail me?</p>
	    <h2 id="about">about me.</h2>
	    <p class="subtitle">ya who is this bozo</p>
	    <p>hi im marigold.</p>
